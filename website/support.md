# Need help?

**Flow** is worked on full-time by Facebook's developer infrastructure team. They're often around and available for questions.

## GitHub issues

The [GitHub issues](https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues) page is a good place to ask questions, find answers, and report issues.

## IRC

Many developers and users idle on Freenode.net's IRC network in the [#flowtype](irc://chat.freenode.net/flowtype) channel.

## Twitter

[@flowtype](https://twitter.com/flowtype) and [#flowtype](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23flowtype) on Twitter are used to keep up with the latest Flow news.
