      <h3>Strict</h3>
      <p>
      Flow is gradual in the sense that it has a dynamic type (any) that
      provides an "escape hatch" for code that cannot be statically typed.

      However, a gradual type system can still aim to provide some guarantees
      for statically typed code, by carefully localizing the effects of
      unsoundness to code that is explicitly typed with any. Such guarantees are crucial for safety and the soundness of compiler transformations for refactoring and performance optimization. Flow is designed to provide such guarantees.

      <h3>Expressive</h3>
      <p>
      Flow precisely tracks the types of variables as they flow through the
      program. It supports nullable types, adjusting the types of local
      variables accordingly. Flow supports dynamic type tests. Flow also
      supports tracking the dynamic initialization of objects.

      <h3>Performance</h3>
      <p>
      Flow performs instantaneous type checking on new changes to both small and
      large code bases.
